# DTW - Dynamic Time Warping

Algorithm can be used to measure similiraty between 2 time series. Originally desiged to use in automatic speech recognition. Objective of the algorithm is to find the optimal global alignment between the two time series, by exlpoiting temporal distortions between the 2 time series.
