# DTW - Dynamic Time Warping

Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm can be used to measure similarity between 2 time series. Originally designed to use in automatic speech recognition. Objective of the algorithm is to find the optimal global alignment between the two time series, by exploiting temporal distortions between the 2 time series.
